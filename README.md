## About

The Open Ethics Transparency Protocol (OETP) is an application-level protocol for publishing and accessing ethical disclosures. The protocol is based on HTTP transfer of OETP-formatted information about the ethical &quot;postures&quot; of Automated Decision-Making (ADM) systems to allow more transparent, predictable, and safe environments for the end-users. The OETP Disclosure Format is an extensible JSON-based format.
