We have researched about Generative AI technologies but we are not sure how to go from there. We would really appreciate any help in guiding us to create the disclosure schema.\r\n\r\nHi, i see, as I mentioned above, you can read about the disclosure principles in the OETP repository and on the IETF page of I-D of the Open Ethics Transparency Protocol.\r\n\r\nThe transparency manifest file that contains the disclosure could be generated on the Open Ethics website (see link in my previous comment), I invite you to try filling out the form and getting the file that includes the disclosure alongside the Open Ethics Label HTML code. Disclosure is a JSON file.\r\n\r\nThe example of \"empty\" disclosure is also here https://github.com/OpenEthicsAI/OETP/blob/main/examples/basic%20disclosure/oetp.json\r\n\r\nWith the same idea as in the Data Passport Schema (https://openethics.ai/schema/oedp.passport.schema.json), the schema for the disclosure will provide the rules for the fields of the Disclosure, e.g. what's optional, what's required, which formats/enums/strings/objects etc. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about JSON schemas as a standardization approach you can visit https://json-schema.org/\r\n",

They are not focused on the technical but in a legal aspect and the judgment on how to work with them may often be subjective. We of course should study them too. \n\nBased on the above, the goal is to study commonalities and differences between the legal frameworks and based on them and the current technology lifecycle, to develop requirements for the elements of the disclosure that should be required or optional and thus cover different frameworks at the same time\n\nThis work aims to create a bridge between the legal and technical requirements and should help product owners with the frame that is agnostic to the legal requirement, free of the legal language, but factual and understandible for the one who disclose or consumes the disclosure at the same time. \n\nThe short-term vision is to make sure multiple elements are mapped and matched across various legal guidelines and frameworks. Again, we're talking about transparency, engineering and safety decisions. \n\nThe long-term vision that the final outcome will be reached iteratively, and \n\nfirst will allow filling in the disclosure and \nlater will allow the unbiased cross-framework judgment to whether the product satisfies or not the given legal frame\n\nThis specific tasks focuses solely on the mapping of the requirements of the AI Act \nAfter its complete we will work on other frameworks, such as NIST\n",

      "body": "## The context\n\n[oetp_current.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19042995/oetp_current.json)\n\nHistorically we've been applying the SHA3-512 integrity signature to the disclosure that was coming from the user-submitted data from https://openethics.ai/label/generate/ directly on the Open Ethics Label server.\n\nThis approach is totally fine in the centralized environment where every step of the process is controlled within Open Ethics infrastructure. However, this approach lacks to deliver on one important aspect - decentralization. The reason for that is because there's no standard way to validate the disclosure without bumping into an issue where the hashes for the same disclosure JSON object don't match. \n\n## How it works right now (see files attached, or generate one yourself)\n1. The user fills in the disclosure form on https://openethics.ai/label/generate/ \n2. The entered data is stored in the JSON object's key `snapshot`\n3. The JSON object gets serialized in JavaScript and is converted into string\n4. The string is sent to the server for the signature\n5. The server injects a Unix timestamp into the `snapshot` as `timestamp` key\n6. The server generates a SHA3-512 signature on the serialized timestamped `snapshot`\n7. The server responds with the timestamped and signed JSON\n8. The signed JSON (timestamped and augmented with the integrity signature) is stored in the DB\n9. The signed JSON is displayed to the user as `oetp.json`\n10. The `oel.html` file with the `iframe` visualization of the Open Ethics Label is displayed to the user, it also contains the integrity signature in iframe src URL\n\n## The problematics\n### A. Scalability\nCurrently the disclosure server managed by the Open Ethics has a limited capacity and is not ready for higher loads or large disclosure files.\n\n### B. Interoperability\nDifferent programming languages perform JSON serialization differently, therefore if one would like to validate the existing disclosure JSON manually they may not receive the same result as was received when this disclosure was signed. This creates a problem because there's no way except for trusting Open Ethics. In addition, this excludes interoperability for external providers, designed in the Open Ethics Transparency Protocol.\n\nSpecifically, \n1. The presence of non-ascii characters in the JSON file could impact the signature and UTF-8 characters will be converted which breaks readability.\n2. The order of the keys in the disclosure JSON if not the same like on the Open Ethics Label page could impact the signature.\n3. The presence of the spaces as additional separators in the string impact the signature.\n\n## Proposed solution\nTo address this issue, it's to (A) decouple the disclosure website and the signature infrastructure as well as to (B) create a transparent criteria of how the integrity signatures should be formed given the [current explanation in 4.1.1 of the OETP](https://openethicsai.github.io/OETP/draft-lukianets-open-ethics-transparency-protocol.html#name-cryptographic-signature) is not concrete enough. \n\n### Acceptance criteria\nIMPORTANT: There is no requirement for the new implementation to generate the signatures which will be the same as in the current implementation, however all the future implementations should rely on the standard description and be cackwards-compatible both for signature generation and for signature validation.\n\n- Documentation: The criteria of the serialized string that should be signed by the SHA3-512 hashing algorithm should be explicit and should be outlined.\n- The result of the signature should be indifferent to the sequence of the keys in the input JSON file\n- The UTF-8 characters should be unescaped in the serialized JSON\n- The demo API `sinature-generate` endpoint for signature should be created\n- The demo API endpoint should accept POST requests with the request body containing the disclosure JSON, but not signed yet\n- The demo API endpoint should return the timestamped and signed JSON\n- The code implementation in Python should be published in the OETP repository in `examples/implementation`\n\n\n### Testing\n#### The integrity signatures issued for disclosure#1 and disclosure#2 should be equal\nDisclosure #1\n```JSON\n{\n    \"disclosure\": {\n    \"timestamp\": 1740917935,\n        \"key1\": \"This is the key1 content\",\n        \"key2\": \"\u2705 this is content with non-ASCII characters\",\n        \"key3\": \"\u0426\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0442 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\",\n        \"key4\": {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDisclosure #2\n```JSON\n{\"disclosure\": {\"key3\": \"\u0426\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0442 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\", \"key1\": \"This is the key1 content\",\"timestamp\": 1740917935,\"key4\": {},\"key2\": \"\u2705 this is content with non-ASCII characters\"}}\n```\n\n#### Equivalence\nGenerated integrity has should be equivalent to using https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha3_512.html or https://www.strerr.com/en/sha3_512.html\n\n### Benefits of the implementation\n- Ability to decouple the front-end and the back-end of the disclosure process during the signature phase.\n- Ability to decentralize disclosure process.\n- Publishing the documentation on the signature process will \n- make validation more transparent, bring trust, and allow for others to implement it too.\n\n## Future steps\n- Implementation of the `signature-validate` endpoint which will be backwards compatible with the disclosures done up-to-date.\n- Transition to the new infrastructure with the decoupled form and the signature\n- Update to the OETP documentation",
