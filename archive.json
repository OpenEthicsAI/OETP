We have researched about Generative AI technologies but we are not sure how to go from there. We would really appreciate any help in guiding us to create the disclosure schema.\r\n\r\nHi, i see, as I mentioned above, you can read about the disclosure principles in the OETP repository and on the IETF page of I-D of the Open Ethics Transparency Protocol.\r\n\r\nThe transparency manifest file that contains the disclosure could be generated on the Open Ethics website (see link in my previous comment), I invite you to try filling out the form and getting the file that includes the disclosure alongside the Open Ethics Label HTML code. Disclosure is a JSON file.\r\n\r\nThe example of \"empty\" disclosure is also here https://github.com/OpenEthicsAI/OETP/blob/main/examples/basic%20disclosure/oetp.json\r\n\r\nWith the same idea as in the Data Passport Schema (https://openethics.ai/schema/oedp.passport.schema.json), the schema for the disclosure will provide the rules for the fields of the Disclosure, e.g. what's optional, what's required, which formats/enums/strings/objects etc. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about JSON schemas as a standardization approach you can visit https://json-schema.org/\r\n",

They are not focused on the technical but in a legal aspect and the judgment on how to work with them may often be subjective. We of course should study them too. \n\nBased on the above, the goal is to study commonalities and differences between the legal frameworks and based on them and the current technology lifecycle, to develop requirements for the elements of the disclosure that should be required or optional and thus cover different frameworks at the same time\n\nThis work aims to create a bridge between the legal and technical requirements and should help product owners with the frame that is agnostic to the legal requirement, free of the legal language, but factual and understandible for the one who disclose or consumes the disclosure at the same time. \n\nThe short-term vision is to make sure multiple elements are mapped and matched across various legal guidelines and frameworks. Again, we're talking about transparency, engineering and safety decisions. \n\nThe long-term vision that the final outcome will be reached iteratively, and \n\nfirst will allow filling in the disclosure and \nlater will allow the unbiased cross-framework judgment to whether the product satisfies or not the given legal frame\n\nThis specific tasks focuses solely on the mapping of the requirements of the AI Act \nAfter its complete we will work on other frameworks, such as NIST\n",
